## As a group of players, we want to keep track of our scores, so we know who is ahead in the game

### Plan

What do we need?

- X Scoreboard -> Component -> has some player child components
- X Player -> Component
  - data
    - score (datatype: number) -> dynamic -> state
    - X name (datatype: string) -> static -> props

## Lifting state ..?

We will get into this once we have our basic scoreboard
